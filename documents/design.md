# Design philosophy

A typical home include room space, objects, living people and perhaps pets. People is no doubt the center, they interact with and manuplate the appliance, read the book, do exercise, and so on. 

Although, every appliance has design user-friendly UI, and try to reduce users' difficulties using them, they still need people to touch the screen on them triggering the preset program within them. 

Nowadays, AI technoligy has evolve so fast that some appliance can be controled by people's oral command.

However, this is not the best solution for user and machines' interactions.

Ideally, if there is a assistant who knows you clearly and do things for you without any interaction or asking, that would be a very good for every participant.
